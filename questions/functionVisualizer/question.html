    The question below was designed to showcase the different features of
    <code>pl-interactive-visualizer</code>. This element creates a 3-dimensional plot of a function 
    that users can rotate, zoom, and place points on. This is a decorative element, and placed points 
    are not saved and graded in the current version. For grading, the element should be combined with
    with `pl-number-input` or other elements where students enter and submit numeric coordinates.

    <p>Below is an example of a function visualization for $3x+x^2y+|y|$, written as the <code>function</code> 
    expression <code>3*x+x**2*y+abs(y)</code>. The parameter <code>place</code> is set to <code>true</code> to allow students to 
    select up to 4 points that are displayed next to the function. These points are not saved or 
    graded unless they are manually entered into a different element, such as <code>pl-number-input</code>.</p>
